# Tensorflow Dev Summit Extended

[The TensorFlow Dev Summit](https://www.tensorflow.org/dev-summit/) brings together a diverse mix of machine learning users from around the world for a full day of highly technical talks, demos, and conversations with the TensorFlow team and community. 

[Tensorflow Dev Summit Extended](https://www.tensorflow.org/dev-summit/viewing-parties/) are organized by local developer communities around the world and show sessions from Summit, perform code-labs, and have fun.

You'll find all presentation, code and other resources shared by our speakers here.
